Create a new notebook and rename it with deeplearning_yourname.ipynb for eg in my case i would rename as deeplearning_puneetindal.ipynb where .ipynb is the extension of the jupyter notebook

click connect 

if you are not on github then do crete a account on github its free


Pull the repository from github
clone the code at https://github.com/EduwaiveFoundation/aictedeeplearning.git


Scrape images data
collect data on local and uploading it or directly push to gcs and explain the scraper and how to write a new one - 1.5 hours. Show some insights on the image data by hitting gcp image analysis api.
Introduction to data management. Show example of GCS and S3 if possible. Uploading the data. Show some examples of moving data from bucket to machine. Or google drive to colab machine
Once data is in colab machine train the models and deploy it. Explain training and canarying process.



You can find the full notebook at below link which we will complete till the end of the sessions. You can use this notebook for reference purposes after you try all of the code
